This capstone treats when and where a workload runs as a decision variable rather than a fixed constraint, and operationalizes that decision as a single actionable signal. Three models were trained independently: an XGBoost classifier labeling a forecast window as low- or high-carbon, an XGBoost regressor estimating national data-center capacity growth from AI-adoption indicators, and a K-Means (k=6) clustering step assigning countries to carbon-sustainability archetypes. These are then fused by a Carbon-Opportunity Signal layer into a Green Window Probability and a RUN WORKLOAD / WAIT / ADJUST recommendation, served identically from a local FastAPI process and an Azure ML Managed Online Endpoint.",

This project extended Monodepth2 (Godard et al., ICCV 2019) with a per-pixel log-variance uncertainty head following Poggi et al. (CVPR 2020). The uncertainty head predicts per-pixel photometric uncertainty and uses it to modulate the NLL loss, automatically down-weighting specular pixels during training without requiring any reflective-surface annotations. The full pipeline was evaluated on the Booster dataset: a high-resolution indoor stereo benchmark with 228 images across 38 scenes containing mirrors, chrome, glass, and other non-Lambertian surfaces.",

Sparsification: NLL log-var AUSE 0.102 / AURG -0.019; MC Dropout AUSE 0.146 / AURG -0.024. Both AURGs are slightly negative, revealing that the learned photometric uncertainty does not perfectly rank depth errors, the model flags specular pixels as uncertain because the photometric training signal is corrupted there, but ground-truth LiDAR depth at those pixels is still accurate, so removing them slightly hurts aggregate metrics. Photometric uncertainty captures appearance unreliability, not geometric error, a key distinction for downstream risk-aware applications.",

The dataset contained 15 training subjects with localizer trials (visual perception, 480 labeled epochs per subject) and imagine trials (mental imagery, 50 epochs per subject), plus 14 unlabeled test subjects. The core challenge is a cross-brain-state domain gap: classifiers must be trained on visual perception signals and applied to mental imagery, a related but neurologically distinct brain process that prior literature shows overlaps only partially with visual perception.
